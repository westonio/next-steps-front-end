# Orbs are reusable packages of CircleCI configuration that you may share across projects, enabling you to create encapsulated, parameterized commands, jobs, and executors that can be used across multiple projects.
# See: https://circleci.com/docs/orb-intro/
orbs:
  node: circleci/node@5.0.0 # Needed for javascript runtime
  heroku: circleci/heroku@1.0.1 # Use the Heroku orb in your config
